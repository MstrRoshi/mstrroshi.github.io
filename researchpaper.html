            <br>
            <br>One local Michigan company is proving to be a top choice for things from fully managed servers, to VPS hosting, to Cloud Computing options. LiquidWeb, with three locations in Lansing, Michigan and one in Arizona, was founded in 1997. They offer a range of products and services to support most any web hosting needs, and has support available around the clock.
<br>
<br> 
Products
<br>
<br>
The company offers a range of dedicated server options. The product line starts at a single 4 core Intel Xeon E3-1220 v2 processor, 8GB of DDR3 RAM, 1TB primary drive with an additional 1TB backup drive and 120GB Kingston SSD bonus dive. Each machine has 5TB of outbound and incoming bandwidth, and price options increase as the processors are upgraded. Their highest option on the company’s site clocks in with 64 total cores at 2.1Ghz. LiquidWeb also offers a range of add-ons including physical firewalls, Storage Area Network (SAN) options with hybrid physical and web hosting for the ability to scale without disruption, backup options and other important features. Using LiquidWeb’s Storm Block Storage (SBS), users can scale up their storage capacity within seconds. These servers have available flash storage, dual power supplies on separate circuits and self-management options for highly specific needs. The importance of these options means the servers are less likely to ever experience downtime since the power would switch between sources. Operating systems include CentOs 6, &7, CloudLinux, Ubuntu and Apache. The importance of these options means the servers are less likely to ever experience downtime since the power would switch between sources. 
<br>
<br>
Security
<br>
<br>
LiquidWeb has many security services available and in operation for their networks. The servers can be made Payment Card Industry compliant, a necessary in modern online transactions. Without compliance with the PCI, payment information stored on a server can be vulnerable. They have a service called ServerSecure which offers a range of features for open source and Windows server platforms. ServerSecure can add a daily CSX scan, SSH/cPanel/FTP/Apache/PHP hardening, brute force detection, DDoS protection and virus scans. They also offer the option to launch a VPN, allowing further security and stability. Using a VPN lets the network act as though your computer is physically connected to the network, encrypting all of the OS’s inputs and outputs. All of these options provide the company’s clients with the availability of a highly protected system designed to fend off most problems an organization looking to host a site would encounter. This allows clients to accept payment and other sensitive information from customers or users without the concern of their system being infiltrated. 
<br>
<br>
Services
<br>
<br>
There are also a large range of hosting services available from LiquidWeb to help clients succeed. They offer load balancing options for servers experiencing high traffic and nine different hosting software packages, allowing their servers to host heavy traffic on beautifully designed web pages and applications. As a branch of their support staff, they also offer a service they call, “Sonar Monitoring,” where a team is designated to be proactive about system maintenance. This team is there to focus on fixing problems before, or as they happen in real time.
